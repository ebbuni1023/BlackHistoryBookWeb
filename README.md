# BlackHistoryBookWeb

## Inspiration
February is the month of Black History. We wanted to honor this month by creating a project dedicated to connecting users to the works of Black authors.

## What it does
Our web app searches for and returns a random book based on the user's genre and length preferences. It is also meant to be an informative site that educates about the importance of Black history.

## How we built it
We used Flask, HTML/CSS to create the website, and Firebase for the backend/login.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to connect the front and backend together at the end. It was also difficult to find an API with just Black authors and their works.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to create a project of this size with minimal experience. We are also proud of being able to create a login with Firebase. This was our first time working with Flask and working with inheriting templates.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about how to work with APIs.

## What's next for BlackHistoryBookWeb
We hope to add more books to the database and have our app generate pictures of the books they recommend. We also want to add more content to the different pages.
